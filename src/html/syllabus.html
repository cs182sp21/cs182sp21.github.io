                <div class="copy">
                <p>You are encouraged to work on homework problems in study groups of two to four people; however, you must <b>always write up the solutions on your own</b>. Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you must <b>always credit all such sources in your writeup and you must never copy material verbatim</b>. We believe that most students can distinguish between helping other students and cheating. Explaining the meaning of a question, discussing a way of approaching a solution, or collaboratively exploring how to solve a problem within your group is an interaction that we strongly encourage. But you should write your homework solution strictly by yourself so that your hands and eyes can help you internalize this material. You must explicitly acknowledge everyone whom you have worked with or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework. Not only is this good scholarly conduct, it also protects you from accusations of being a jerk or free-rider regarding your colleagues' ideas.</p>

<p>Warning: Your attention is drawn to the <a href="http://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/Policies/acad.dis.shtml">Department's Policy on Academic Dishonesty</a>. In particular, you should be aware that copying or sharing solutions, in whole or in part, from other students in the class or any other source without acknowledgment constitutes cheating. Any student found to be cheating risks automatically failing the class and being referred to the Office of Student Conduct.</p>

<p>However, we are very fair. No student will be accused of cheating without a human being looking over their case. And nobody will be sent to Student Conduct without at least the head TA and Prof concurring that this is warranted and makes sense. Algorithms help us focus our attention, but decisions are made by compassionate human beings.</p>

                    <p>Important Note:</p>

                    <p>We will encourage more student participation on Piazza
                        rather
                        than answering right away, that is, we will wait until
                        other students step
                        up and answer questions.</p>

                    <p>Of course, we will still provide clarifications on
                        logistics, typos,
                        subtle points, etc.</p>

                    <p>We want to make sure that you are helping each other out,
                        and having
                        instructors give away the answers isn't the most
                        beneficial for your
                        education either.</p>
                </blockquote>


                <p>In order to make Piazza a better resource for everyone, we've
                    outlined some
                    guidelines for you to follow when posting your questions.
                    Questions which
                    follow these guidelines will have a higher chance of being
                    answered!</p>


                <h3>1. Ask HW questions only in HW posts.</h3>
                <p>We've created individual posts for each problem from
                    homework.
                    Please ask questions, discuss problems, or help out in those
                    posts only.
                    Before asking a question, read through (or search) the whole
                    post to see
                    if your question has been answered. </p>

                <h3>2. Don't post answers in Piazza.</h3>

                <p>Please don't give away the answer on Piazza.
                    You can explain things in a way that still lets other
                    students figure out
                    the essence of the problem on their own, but don't spoil the
                    problem. For
                    example, don't point to a useful YouTube link that works out
                    essentially
                    what the problem is asking about.</p>

                <p>That is not cool.</p>

                <p>Post such spoilers after the HW is due. That is totally fine.
                    If you are not
                    sure, post privately to instructors and then we'll let you
                    know.</p>

                <h3>3. Try to make posts public.</h3>

                <p>While not violating Rule 2, try to make your questions
                    public, because
                    others might have the same question and we don't need to
                    answer them
                    multiple times.</p>


                <h3>4. Piazza is not OH. 5 minute-test.</h3>

                <p>If you think your questions may take more than 5 minutes to
                    answer,
                    please come to office hours or homework parties instead.</p>


                <h3>5. Neither Piazza nor TAs are for pre-grading.</h3>

                <p>Please do not post questions of the form:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Is this the correct solution to HW X problem Y?"</li>
                    <li>"Would this receive full credit on HW X problem Y?"</li>
                    <li>"Is this the right level of detail for hw X problem
                        Y?"
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <p>Please do not use Piazza as a medium to ask instructors to
                    check your
                    homework in advance. We simply cannot check every student's
                    homework through
                    Piazza.</p>

                <p>Feel free to ask questions of clarification, or ask questions
                    about the
                    course content to achieve a deeper understanding, but at a
                    certain point,
                    you must apply your knowledge, give it your best shot, and
                    submit your
                    answers with confidence.</p>


                <h3>6. Post a screen shot of any resource referenced.</h3>

                <p>Your question should be self-contained. The TAs (and other
                    responders)
                    should not have to scan through PDFs to even figure out what
                    the
                    question is. Ask yourself: am I referring to some lecture
                    slide/lecture note/HW solution/discussion solution/past exam?</p>

                <p>If the answer is yes, post a screen shot of the relevant
                    part.</p>

                <h3>7. Post all your work.</h3>

                <p>Don't post one line saying:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    At step n, I get XYZ, and I'm now confused.
                </blockquote>

                <p>This forces the TAs to guess:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>What happened in steps 1, 2, ..., n - 1?</p>

                    <p>Most likely, the TAs will guess wrong, and we run into
                        a mess of followup questions trying to figure out
                        what steps 1, 2, ..., n - 1 were.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Instead, post:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Starting out, we have: ....</p>
                    <p>Then, I do ..., and I get ...</p>
                    <p>Next, I do ..., and I get ...</p>
                    <p>Next, I do ..., and I get ...</p>
                    <p>Now, I get $&amp;%&amp;#(, and this makes no sense.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Then, the TA can respond:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    The mistake is at step 3, you're not allowed to apply ABC to
                    XYZ
                    because ...
                </blockquote>


                <h3>8. Post narrow, precise questions.</h3>


                <p>Question of the form "Can someone please explain stable
                    marriage to me?"
                    are not helpful.

                <p>There's an entire lecture note written on it. There are
                    multiple parts to stable marriage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>actual algorithm</li>
                    <li>proof of termination</li>
                    <li>proof of stability</li>
                    <li>proof that it's male optimal</li>
                    <li>proof that it's female pessimal</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No TA is arrogant enough to think they can rewrite the
                    lecture
                    better
                    than notes that have evolved over decades of teaching.
                    Instead,
                    the
                    question should be precise, like:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Title: Can someone please explain this step of the proof
                        of stability?</p>
                    <p>Body:</p>
                    <p>[Image of Stable Marriage Algorithm]</p>
                    <p>[Image of Proof of Stability (with an arrow draw in)]</p>
                    <p>In the proof of stability, I get that we have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>fact 1 in your own words</li>
                        <li>fact 2 in your own words</li>
                        <li>fact 3 in your own words</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, I don't get how we get:
                    <ul>
                        <li>fact 4 in your own words</li>
                    </ul>
